## Usage (for agents)

### Consuming Outrun

Outrun is a foundational library that other projects build on. If you are an agent working in a downstream project that depends on Outrun:

1. Check the version of Outrun your project currently uses (look at the dependency pin in your project's manifest, or the vendored copy's `library.json` / `idf_component.yml`).
2. Check the latest version of Outrun in this changelog.
3. Read every section between those two versions and update your project's code accordingly — paying particular attention to **Breaking changes**.

### Updating this changelog

Each version section is headed `## vX.Y.Z-dev (<git-hash>)`, where `<git-hash>` is the short hash of the commit that introduced the section (or the most recent commit it covers, if updated in place).

Standard subsections, in order, omitting any that are empty:

- **Breaking changes** — API changes that require downstream code updates.
- **New features** — additions that are backward-compatible.
- **Fixes** — bug fixes.
- **Internal** — refactors, tooling, tests, docs — anything not visible to consumers.

A `-dev` version section is a work-in-progress: continue appending to it as work lands. When a semver version is **struck** (the `-dev` suffix is removed and the version is released), that section is frozen — do not modify it. New work then opens a fresh `## vX.Y.Z-dev (<git-hash>)` section above it.
